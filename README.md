Coding Challenge 5: Introducing Structures

Objective: This exercise will teach you how to use structures to organize and manage data more effectively. You will encapsulate the properties and functions related to your app within a structure.

Step 1: Copy Over Coding Challenge Solution 4 to a new Swift file in a separate repository named "Coding Challenge Solution 5".

Step 2: Implement the following features in your new file:

Part 1: Creating a Structure:
------------
Define a Structure:
- Create a structure named App to encapsulate the properties and methods related to your app.
- Move the constants, variables, and functions you created in previous challenges into this structure.

-----------
Initialize the Structure:
- Create an instance of the App structure and initialize it with the appropriate values.

------------------
Challenge Tasks:

Add More Properties and Methods:
- Add a property for the description of the new feature.
- Add a method to update the app version and downloads as simulated in Challenge 1.
- Add a method to update the user rating based on new positive and negative reviews.
  
Refactor Your Code:
- Use the new methods to update the app's version, downloads, and user rating.
-Ensure that your main code is clean and calls these methods to perform the necessary updates.
